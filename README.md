# IOT-Projects

 Today, Internet application development demand is very high. So IoT is a major technology by which we can produce various useful internet applications.

Basically, IoT is a network in which all physical objects are connected to the internet through network devices or routers and exchange data. IoT allows objects to be controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure. IoT is a very good and intelligent technique which reduces human effort as well as easy access to physical devices. This technique also has autonomous control feature by which any device can control without any human interaction.

“Things” in the IoT sense, is the mixture of hardware, software, data, and services. “Things” can refer to a wide variety of devices such as DNA analysis devices for environmental monitoring, electric clamps in coastal waters, Arduino chips in home automation and many other. These devices gather useful data with the help of various existing technologies and share that data between other devices. Examples include Home Automation System which uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for exchange data between various devices of home.

## IOT -  the new revolution

When we look at today’s state of technologies, we get a clear indication of how IoT will be implemented on a global level in near future. Use of the internet is increasing day-by-day. Commute and connectivity became easier in the present scenario. In near future, the number of internet connected devices would increase exponentially.

Although there are some issues in IoT. These issues can be removed in near future. With such a rapid growth, the day is not too far that we can decide our dinner even before reaching home on the way.
